🏢 Real Estate Market Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

This project provides a structured data science–oriented investigation of residential real estate listings from St. Petersburg and nearby localities.
The primary objective is to understand the underlying structure of the dataset, reveal the key drivers of property value, and prepare a clean and interpretable feature space suitable for downstream machine learning tasks.

🎯 Project Objectives (DS-Oriented)<br/>
	•	Analyze structural patterns in the dataset and evaluate its suitability for predictive modeling.<br/>
	•	Identify features with strong explanatory power for price and price per m².<br/>
	•	Quantify the impact of spatial, structural, and temporal factors on market value.<br/>
	•	Detect data inconsistencies, anomalies, and noise that may degrade model performance.<br/>
	•	Engineer interpretable, domain-driven features for future regression or ranking models.<br/>
	•	Establish a robust EDA foundation to inform the architecture of a predictive pricing mode<br/>
